1) The original data can be found on Kaggle. 

2) For interpreting the code, read train-test-split.R first and then read mymain.R.

3) Also remember, some modifcications to the data can be done only for the train set and not the test set.

4) The csv file attached contains the different test ids for splitting the data. 

5) Try running the code with different splits.
